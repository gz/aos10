initially all pages from frame_alloc marked dirty

---
timer goes off at x ms
 - pick random mapped page
 - unmaps from kernel pagetable (& flush cache?)
 - puts page in working set

OR:

pagefault happens, frame_alloc != NULL
 - insert page in circular list

timer goes off at x ms
 - unmap all pages inserted into circular list since last trigger
---

pagefault happens, frame_alloc == NULL
 - pick a page in working set which is not mapped back into the kernel
 - if dirty bit is set (page is mapped with write perms), swap page to disk
 - remove dirty bit: set the access rights to read only
