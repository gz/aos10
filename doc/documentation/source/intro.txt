Introduction
============

This document is intended to provide insights about our implementation of
the Advanced Operating System (AOS) project [#f1]_.

Our project consists mainly on two parts: The SOS Server and a libsos library
provided for user processes to communicate with the SOS Server.
For our SOS Server we choose to go implement it in a monolithic single threaded
fashion. We expected to have the least trouble with this approach as the project 
would evolve.

* The :ref:`memory-management` Chapter will give insights about
  how the SOS server manages the memory of user processes.

* The :ref:`syscall-interface` Chapter explains how user
  processes communicate with the SOS Server.

* The :ref:`io-subsystem` Chapter explains the code responsible for 
  reading and writing files on the NFS server as well as reading and writing 
  from and to the serial port.

* The :ref:`process` Chapter contains information about how we manage
  user processes in the root server.
