Memory Management
=================

Memory management related code resides within the :file:`src/sos/mm/` directory. It consists of
three parts:

#. Frame Management
#. Pager (handles process page faults)
#. Swapping (swaps pages in and out of physical memory)

.. hint:: To test the Swapping it is recommended to reduce the number of physical frames artificially. This can be done by uncommenting ``SWAP_TEST`` (:file:`frames.c:25`). The amount of frames is then defined through ``SWAP_FRAMES_LIMIT`` (:file:`frames.c:30`).



Virtual Address Space Layout
----------------------------
The address space for a process is set up according to the following diagram:

.. image:: _images/address_space.png
    :width: 110%

You may notice that everything below ``0x02000000`` is not accessible. The reason for
this is that loading of an ELF binary and copying text and data sections
is done by a privileged piece of code running in the same address space 
but with the capability to access physical memory directly 
(i.e. everything below ``0x02000000``). For more information refer to the 
:ref:`process-creation` chapter.


Virtual Address Layout
----------------------
We use a fixed page size of 4096 bytes which requires us to use a 12 bit offset
in our virtual address. Since the CPU has a word size of 32 bit we can address :math:`2^{20}` frames
with the remaining 20 bits (and since the NSLU2 has only 32 MB RAM
this is more than enough).
We decided to use a 2 level page table using the top 12 bits
of an address as an index in the page directory (1st level) and the following 8 bits
as an index in the second level page table. All page tables are stored in the heap
memory of the SOS server (which we set up to use a reserved region of 5 MB in
physical memory). This approach favors simplicity but it probably would have been
wise to use physical frames for better scalability with multiple concurrent
processes.


Functioning of the Pager
------------------------
Implementing demand paging was probably the most difficult part of the project. In this 
chapter we try to give an overview of the interactions between a user space process,
our sos kernel and the network during page faults.

The first diagram (see :ref:`swap-out-sequence`) shows the steps taken in case
a certain memory region is accessed for the first time (this means that the page
is not swapped and there exists no mapping in the software or hardware page table
for it). As we can see, once the system needs to swap out we select a page 
based on the second chance algorithm. We implemented second chance using a queue
where we keep all the pages currently associated with a physical frame.
Notice that in the diagrams the entities Pager, Swapper and :abbr:`NFS (Network File System)` handler are not
separate processes but rather refer to functions located in different code files.
To give a better overview we decided to split it up anyways even though all 
of these functions are called in the SOS syscall loop.

.. _swap-out-sequence:

    Access a page for the first time

If one takes a look at the structure ``page_queue_item`` (:file:`swapper.h:9`)
he will notice that we store a bunch of information there to help
us identify to which process a page belongs to, find the correct swap offset 
and corresponding page table entry. 
While a page is swapped out it's corresponding ``page_queue_item`` is
inserted in the swapping queue. This is needed because swapping in and out 
leads to an asynchronous :abbr:`NFS (Network File System)` callback in the server so in case a process 
is deleted while it's waiting for a page fault we need to be able to detect this
in the callback (see also :ref:`process-deletion`). The swap file stores only 
page content and can currently hold about 5000 pages (although this can easily be
changed by setting ``MAX_SWAP_ENTRIES`` in :file:`swapper.c:64`). The offset of a page in the swap file
is stored in the page table entry during the time a page is swapped out 
and once it is back in memory gets copied into the corresponding
``page_queue_item``.

The next diagram (see :ref:`swap-in-sequence`) shows the steps taken in case
a page is requested which was already mapped before but currently does not
exist in the hardware page table.

.. _swap-in-sequence:

.. figure:: _images/swap_in_sequence.png
    :scale: 110%
    :alt: Sequence Diagram: Request a page

    Requesting a previously mapped page

As we can see we have to distinguish two cases:

#. If the page is currently in the swap file we need to read it back into physical memory. Notice also that we create the corresponding ``page_queue_item`` before we called ``nfs_read()`` so we can pass its address as an argument which is handed back later in the callback.
#. If the page is already in physical memory we just update the hardware page table using ``L4_MapFpage()``.

Now that we've seen the sequence patterns used to handle page faults we will take a closer look at the states a page can be in and how they affect our
data structures (see :ref:`page-state`).

* You may notice that once a page is dereferenced only page faults with read request can happen. This is because in L4 the first access to an unmapped page will always deliver a read page fault, even if the fault is from a write instruction. Once a page is mapped, subsequent faults will report the correct access.
* Since the ARM CPU does not provide reference and dirty bits. We simulated the reference/dereference operation by mapping and unmapping the page in the hardware page table.
* The dirty bit is stored in the lower 12 bits of our software page table. A page referenced for the first time it is always marked as dirty. This is needed because in the beginning nothing is swapped out. Once a page is swapped out the dirty bit is cleared in the page table but is reset again if the page gets mapped with write access in the future.
